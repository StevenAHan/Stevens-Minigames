# Steven's Minigames
A website hosting a collection of minigames and solvers for minigames that I have made. The apps include: 24GameSolver

## 24GameSolver
An application that finds all the solutions to a set of numbers in the popular 24 Game, where the objective is to find a way to multiply, add, subtract, and divide all of the numbers in a way to reach 24.

### How to Use

In the numbers, type in at most 6 numbers, separated by at least one space, and select whether you want to see the solution or not. Then click the button and see the result.
